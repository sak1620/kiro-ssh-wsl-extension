```

#### **Copy Public Key to Server**
```
"Copy my SSH public key to my server for passwordless login"
```

#### **Use SSH Keys Instead of Passwords**
```javascript
// In your code, use SSH keys
const config = {
    host: 'server.com',
    username: 'user',
    privateKey: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/private/key')
};
```

### **Connection Security**

#### **Change Default SSH Port**

```

#### **Execute Commands on Multiple Servers**
```
"Execute 'uptime' on all my SSH servers"
"Update packages on all my connected servers"

Create `~/.ssh/config` for easier connections:
```
Host webserver
    HostName web.example.com
    User deploy
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/webserver_key

Host dbserver
    HostName db.example.com
